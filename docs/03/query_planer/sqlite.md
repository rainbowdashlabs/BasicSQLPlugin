# SqLite

SqLite does only offer a pretty bad representation of query plans. Therefore, I will refrain from explaining it in
more detail. The output is subject to change at any time and the tutorial text can be outdated at any time.

Have a look at the [documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_explain.html) yourself. However, if your data gets that large that you need to analyze query
plans in sqlite you should probably switch to a more robust database like MariaDB or PostgreSQL.
