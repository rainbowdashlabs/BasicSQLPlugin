# Preface

Welcome to the SQL and Java page.

I am Chojo (some people refer to me as Lilly or Hadde) and I am a software developer. During my work I mostly work with
SQL and spend most of my day with data transformation and querying. I also work a lot with functions written in `plpgsql`,
which is the SQL dialect the PostgreSQL database uses

When I started using databases a few years ago I made a lot of mistakes and bad decisions regarding design and
integrations of databases in my projects. Most probably just because no one told me that I was doing it wrong.

Some years ago I started with programming Minecraft plugins and had more and more contact with people who wanted to
start programming as well. Many of them started using databases and made the same mistakes I did. The most known source
for database code was the spigot wiki at this point which taught a horrible way, which was working in the first way, but
had a lot of flaws. I decided that we need a better text which does not use methods from java 6 times. I started a
GitHub repository and added a small readme. This readme was way too long at the end, but I barely covered the basics.

A year later I decided to revisit my text, structure it properly, add more information and answer some frequently asked
questions. That's where we are today.

That's also the reason why some texts contain references to minecraft development. But the best practises written
here can be applied to all applications.
