# Data Consistency

Data consistency is key when it comes to databases. In an ideal world a database removes invalid data by itself and
ensures that only valid data gets inserted. Luckily all our databases give us the tools we need to accomplish those
ideal goals. They are called unique indices, constrains, foreign keys and more.
