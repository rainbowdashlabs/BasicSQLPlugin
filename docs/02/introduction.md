# Chapter 2

Welcome to chapter two. Now we have set up the database of our choice and also installed a tool to access our 
databases. Of course, we could start now directly with writing cool SQL queries, but first we need to talk about 
some very important stuff.

We will start with learning about operators. Especially about operators to transform and compare data. Because those 
operators heavily depend on the datatypes we use we will directly head over to them and take a look at the different 
types our databases offer to us.

Before we can now finally start with creating our first database and creating our tables we will need to define some 
important thing, that is naming. A clear structure in your database will make your life a lot easier and helps 
others to understand what you are doing.

After this we will take a first look on how to create tables and insert, update, select and delete data in these tables.
